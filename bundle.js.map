The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *\n * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 121 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nvar _curry1 = __webpack_require__(65);\nvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(34);\n\n\n/**\n * Optimized internal two-arity curry function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nmodule.exports = function _curry2(fn) {\n  return function f2(a, b) {\n    switch (arguments.length) {\n      case 0:\n        return f2;\n      case 1:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) ? f2\n             : _curry1(function(_b) { return fn(a, _b); });\n      default:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(b) ? f2\n             : _isPlaceholder(a) ? _curry1(function(_a) { return fn(_a, b); })\n             : _isPlaceholder(b) ? _curry1(function(_b) { return fn(a, _b); })\n             : fn(a, b);\n    }\n  };\n};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 122 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nvar _arity = __webpack_require__(64);\nvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(34);\n\n\n/**\n * Internal curryN function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n  return function() {\n    var combined = [];\n    var argsIdx = 0;\n    var left = length;\n    var combinedIdx = 0;\n    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n      var result;\n      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n        result = received[combinedIdx];\n      } else {\n        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n        argsIdx += 1;\n      }\n      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n        left -= 1;\n      }\n      combinedIdx += 1;\n    }\n    return left <= 0 ? fn.apply(this, combined)\n                     : _arity(left, _curryN(length, combined, fn));\n  };\n};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 123 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n/**\n * Copyright 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

easy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor anyone to join in a jam session. I designed the interface to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trelflect the mental model I have in my head when I'm playing music\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut you don't need to know any music theory or really anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout music. I'm going to include some fancy vocabulary in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texplanation because its interesting for those who know some music\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheory, but just skip over if you don't understand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo play the instrument, select a set of notes from the pie on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleft&mdash;this is your scale. Those notes get laid out on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkeyboad to the right. On a desktop, use can use the asdf row of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkeys to play the notes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For example, here is the major scale.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style={{ maxWidth: 300, margin: \"auto\" }}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={major} style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can rotate the pie to create different modes and the keyboard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill slide around accordingly. For example, here's the second mode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the major scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style={{ maxWidth: 300, margin: \"auto\" }}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src={minor} style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\" }} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow if you play several notes at the same time to play a chord,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can rotate the pie to change the chord without moving your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfingers. You can play an entire chord progression this way just by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trotating the pie!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIdeally, this instrument would have a tool that allows you to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvisualize the frequencies from a microphone on the pie (similar to{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://ccorcos.github.io/circle/\">Circle</a>) allowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou to easily find all of the \"right\" notes when hopping into a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjam session. It would also be convenient to have some presets\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you can save scales so you can change between scales during\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta jam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSadly, this instrument isn't as playable as I'd like. Playing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsomething on a screen is nothing like playing a real phsical\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstrument. But there are still some interesting things I've\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered from this instrument.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The pentatonic scale is the inverse of the major scale.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe tritone substitution is simply a reflection of a chord on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pie!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat's it for now.
